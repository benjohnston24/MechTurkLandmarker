# Introduction

You will be marking key points on images of fish, which will help determine the
shape of different fishes and how that affects their performance in the water.
Please continue reading for a short primer on fish anatomy, and a description
of the points that you will need to mark on each photograph.

If you have questions, comments, or suggestions for improvement, contact Jonathan
Chang via email: **jonathan dot chang at ucla dot edu**. This research is

### Common problems

* **Fin damage**: mark it as best you can and leave a comment in the comment
  box.
* **Fin obscured**: make a good guess based on the shape of the visible
  portion of the fin, and leave a comment indicating this
* **Can't find caudal fin points**: The caudal fin has two parts: a fleshy
  part and a part with the fin rays. Points 1 and 2 are where the fleshy part
  attaches to the rest of the fish body and is usually quite narrow, while
  points 3 and 4 are where the fin rays begin. See the diagram below -- there
  is a clear difference between the flesh and the ray, so look for this difference when marking points.

# Fish anatomy

![Anatomical directions and fin names](../img/anatomy.png)

Anatomical locations

* Anterior: towards the mouth.
* Posterior: towards the tail.
* Dorsal: towards the backbone.
* Ventral: towards the belly.

Fish fins

* Fin rays are the soft spines that make up a fish's fins. They are clearly
  visible in the drawing above on each of the labeled fins.
* Pectoral fin: The fins that are on each side of the fish, usually near the eye. You will only see one pectoral fin as the second fin is on the other side of the fish.
* Dorsal fin: The fins that lie on the back of the fish. Triggerfishes will have two dorsal fins; you will landmark the second (posterior) fin.
* Anal fin: The fin that is on the ventral side of the fish, past the anus.
* Caudal fin: The tail fin of the fish. The caudal fin has two main parts: the part where the backbone extends into the caudal fin, and the part that contains the fin rays. These two can usually be distinguished by a change in color or texture.

# Landmarks

![Overview of all landmarks](../img/landmarks-small.jpg)

You will need to mark:

* 3 mouth
* 1 eye
* 2 dorsal fin
* 2 pectoral fin
* 2 anal fin
* 4 caudal fin

![3 mouth landmarks](../img/mouth.jpg)

**Mouth**: Mark the upper (m1) and lower (m2) tips of the mouth opening, as well as the point that shows the angle (m3) of the mouth opening.

![1 eye landmark](../img/eye.jpg)

**Eye**: Mark the center (e1) of the eye. If finding the center is difficult, draw two perpendicular lines through the oval of the eye. The center of the eye is at the intersection of those two lines.

![2 dorsal fin landmarks](../img/dorsal.jpg)

**Dorsal fin**: Mark where the first (d1) and last (d2) fin ray attach to the body of the fish.

![2 anal fin landmarks](../img/anal.jpg)

**Anal fin**: Mark where the first (a1) and last (a2) fin ray attaches to the body of the
fish.

![2 pectoral fin landmarks](../img/pectoral.jpg)

**Pectoral fin**: Mark where the dorsal (p1) and ventral (p2) fin ray attach to the body of the
fish.

![4 caudal fin landmarks](../img/caudal.jpg)

**Caudal fin**: Mark the dorsal (c1) and ventral (c2) base of the caudal fin. This is usually the narrow part between the fin and the rest of the fish body. Then, mark the spot where the dorsal (c3) and ventral (c4) caudal fin rays attach to the rest of the caudal fin. You can usually distinguish the start of the caudal fin rays by a change in color or texture.
