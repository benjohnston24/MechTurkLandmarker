# Introduction

You will be marking key points on images of fish, which will help determine the shape of different fishes and how that affects their performance in the water. Please continue reading for a short primer on fish anatomy, and a description of the points that you will need to mark on each photograph.

If you have questions, comments, or suggestions for improvement, contact Jonathan Chang via email: **jonathan dot chang at ucla dot edu**. This research is supported by the Encyclopedia of Life Rubenstein Fellowship and by NSF DEB-0918748.

# Fish anatomy

![Anatomical directions](img/fish_directions.png)

* Anterior: towards the mouth.
* Posterior: towards the tail.
* Dorsal: towards the top.
* Ventral: towards the bottom.
* Distal: the point furthest from the point of attachment to the body (for fins, etc)

![](img/fish_fins.png)

Fin rays are the soft spines that make up a fish's fins. They are clearly visible in the picture above on each of the labeled fins.

* Pectoral fin: The fins that are on each side of the fish, usually near the eye. You will only see one pectoral fin as the second fin is on the other side of the fish.
* Dorsal fin: The fins that lie on the back of the fish. If a fish has two dorsal fins, you will landmark the first (anterior) fin.
* Pelvic fin: The fin below the pectoral fin.
* Anal fin: The fin that is on the ventral side of the fish behind the anus.
* Caudal fin: The tail fin of the fish. The caudal fin has two main parts: the part where the backbone extends into the caudal fin (caudal peduncle), and the part that contains the fin rays. These can be distinguished by a change in color or texture.


# Tasks

## Mouth

![](img/J1.png)

J1: The tip of the upper jaw.

![](img/J2.png)

J2: The intersection of the upper and lower jaw. This is not simply where the flesh of the upper and lower jaw meet!
![](img/J2_wrong.png)

![](img/J3.png)

J3: The tip of the lower jaw.

## Eye

![](img/E1.png)

E1: The most anterior (forward) margin of the eye at its widest diameter.

![](img/E2.png)

E2: The most posterior (rearward) margin of the eye at its widest diameter.

## Operculum

![](img/fish_operculum.png)

The preoperculum points (O1-O3) might not be visible in certain fishes. If you really can't find them place their points at the top-left corner of the image and make a comment in the comment box saying so.

![](img/O1.png)

O1: The top point of the preopercule.

![](img/O2.png)

O2: The posterior (rearward) \"elbow\" of the preopercule.

![](img/O3.png)

O3: The bottom point of the preopercule.

![](img/O4.png)

O4: The top point of the operculum (gill cover).

![](img/O5.png)

O5: The posterior (rearward) point of the operculum (gill cover).

## Pectoral fin

![](img/P1.png)

P1: Top intersection of pectoral fin rays with the base of the pectoral fin.

![](img/P2.png)

P2: Bottom intersection of pectoral fin rays with the base of the pectoral fin.

## Caudal fin

![](img/C1.png)

C1: Top intersection of the tail fin rays with the body.

![](img/C2.png)

C2: Bottom intersection of the tail fin rays with the body.


## Dorsal head curve

![](img/DH.png)

DH: Curve of the body running from the [tip of the upper jaw (J1)](#mouth) to the [base of the dorsal fin (DF)](#dorsal-fin).

## Dorsal fin

![](img/DF.png)

DF: Curve of the base of the dorsal fin, from the anterior to posterior fin ray insertions.

![](img/DM.png)

DM: Curve of the distal margin of the dorsal fin, from the tip of the first (anterior) fin ray to the last fin ray.


## Ventral head curve

![](img/VH.png)

VH: Curve of the body running from the [tip of the lower jaw (J3)](#mouth) to the base of the [pelvic fin](#fish-anatomy).

## Anal fin

![](img/AF.png)

AF: Curve of of the base of the anal fin, from the anterior to posterior fin ray insertions.

![](img/AM.png)

AM: Curve of the distal margin of the anal fin, from the tip of the first (anterior) fin ray to the last fin ray.


## Measurements

![](img/SL.png)

SL: Line from [tip of the upper jaw (J1)](#mouth) to midpoint of the [base of the tail (between C1 and C2)](#caudal-fin).

![](img/DP.png)

DP: The longest straight line that can be drawn through the fish from top to the bottom.
