# Introduction

You will be marking key points on images of fish, which will help determine the shape of different fishes and how that affects their performance in the water. Please continue reading for a short primer on fish anatomy, and a description of the points that you will need to mark on each photograph.

If you have questions, comments, or suggestions for improvement, contact Jonathan Chang via email: **jonathan dot chang at ucla dot edu**. This research is supported by the Encyclopedia of Life Rubenstein Fellowship and by NSF DEB-0918748.

**NOTE: You may not be asked to mark all of these points on a fish. Follow the instructions on the HIT page that you came from.**
