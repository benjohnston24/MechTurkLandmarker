# Introduction

You will be marking key points on images of fish, which will help determine the
shape of different fishes and how that affects their performance in the water.
Please continue reading for a short primer on fish anatomy, and a description
of the points that you will need to mark on each photograph.

If you have questions, comments, or suggestions for improvement, contact Jonathan
Chang via email: **jonathan dot chang at ucla dot edu**. This research is
supported by the Encyclopedia of Life Rubenstein Fellowship and by NSF DEB-0918748.

### Common problems

* **Fin damage**: mark it as best you can and leave a comment in the comment
  box.
* **Fin obscured**: make a good guess based on the shape of the visible
  portion of the fin, and leave a comment indicating this
* **Can't find caudal fin points**: The caudal fin has two parts: a fleshy
  part and a part with the fin rays. Points 1 and 2 are where the fleshy part
  attaches to the rest of the fish body and is usually quite narrow, while
  points 3 and 4 are where the fin rays begin. See the diagram below -- there
  is a clear difference between the flesh and the ray, so look for this difference when marking points.

# Fish anatomy

![Anatomical directions and fin names](../img/anatomy.png)

Anatomical locations

* Anterior: towards the mouth.
* Posterior: towards the tail.
* Dorsal: towards the backbone.
* Ventral: towards the belly.

Fish fins

* Fin rays are the soft spines that make up a fish's fins. They are clearly
  visible in the drawing above on each of the labeled fins.
* Pectoral fin: The fins that are on each side of the fish, usually near the eye. You will only see one pectoral fin as the second fin is on the other side of the fish.
* Dorsal fin: The fins that lie on the back of the fish. Triggerfishes will have two dorsal fins; you will landmark the second (posterior) fin.
* Anal fin: The fin that is on the ventral side of the fish, past the anus.
* Caudal fin: The tail fin of the fish. The caudal fin has two main parts: the part where the backbone extends into the caudal fin, and the part that contains the fin rays. These two can usually be distinguished by a change in color or texture.

# Things to digitize

## Landmarks

* Upper and lower jaw tips of mouth opening, plus angle of opening (back of mouth)
* Dorsal fin (anterior and posterior insertion of fin ray)
* Caudal fin (dorsal and ventral insertion of fin ray)
* Anal fin (anterior and posterior insertion of fin ray)
* Pectoral fin (dorsal and ventral insertion of fin ray)
* Anterior and posterior side of the eye

## Semilandmarks

* Curve between mouth landmark and anterior dorsal fin insertion lanldmark
* Margin of dorsal fin
* Margin of anal fin
* Curve between mouth landmark and anterior fin ray of the ventral fin

## Linear measurements
* Standard length (mouth landmark to caudal fin ray insertion landmark)
* Depth (biggest dorsal to ventral distance, excluding fins)

## Bruno remarks

* 11-17 may not be biologically relevant (hard to estimate epaxial area from external morphology)
* Redefine 11 as "top of the operculum"
* 13 may be difficult to get as not every species has an obvious "elbow"
* Include most posterior of operculum as landmark, so distance from 2 can give an idea of cranium length
* Measure depth
* Forehead semilandmark may show little variation
* Include tip of mandible to get an estimate of mandible length with 1 or 14
* Linear measurements: cranium length, eye length, standard length, depth
* Ratios: eye:cranium, cranium:SL, depth:SL, deepest part:SL
